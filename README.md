RESOURCE FOLDER IN AUTOPLUG3 IS OUTDATED AND WILL NEVER BE UPDATED SINCE IT TAKES A LONG TIME.
Since you can use 7-Zip to access the vpk data.
# Autoplugin III
Autoplugin for PSVITA
This tool allows you to install/uninstall plugins with one click.

# Optional settings
- Update plugins Online
- Update Languages Online
- Download/Install ITLS-Enso and Battery fixer (vpk)
- Set a Custom Image (Custom Boot Splash is required)
- Set a Custom Warning Message (Custom Warning is required)
- Set Level Transparent (Transparent Impose is required)

# Small note for Splash image
To load a custom image at boot, the image must be in png format sized to 960X544 named splash.png and it must be placed in the path ux0:CustomBootsplash/splash.png.
You no longer need to add the line:
 "- load ur0: tai / custom_boot_splash.skprx".
# Small note for the translation of the languages using non-standard characters
Download the  *([font.pgf](https://github.com/hedhehd/Autoplugin3/blob/master/font/font.pgf)).* and insert it in the path **ux0:data/Autoplugin2/font**. (Remember if the font folder does not exist you have to create it) 
This fixes missing non-standard characters, not found at english charset. Those will show as "_" instead of the unusual letter.
